## Cellar

Cellar is a collection of community-curated open datasets for insurance
analytics. It promotes usability and discoverability of insurance
datasets by conforming to tidy data principles and making data available via a
uniform interface.

## data.txt and pins

Cellar is organized according to the [data.txt specification](https://datatxt.org/),
which outlines how websites describe their data content. The [datasets](dataset/),
which are documented on this site,
can be accesed via the pins package (available in [R](https://rstudio.github.io/pins/)
and [Python](https://rstudio.github.io/pins/#python)).

For example, to access the [Schedule P dataset](https://cellar.kasa.ai/dataset/schedule_p/), you can execute the
following:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# install.packages("pins")
library(pins)
library(dplyr)
board_register_datatxt("cellar", "https://cellar.kasa.ai")
schedule_p <- pin_get("schedule_p", board = "cellar")
glimpse(schedule_p)
```

We are in the process of migrating data from various online sources to Cellar.
